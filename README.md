## Introduction
In this project, we used history chat content of three different alliances obtained directly from strategy game Nova Empire II to reveal the topic duration via factors analysis of participator, content, and social network for social system applications.

## Requirements
Install dependency in a Python>=3.7.0 environment

    pip install bertopic
    pip install nltk
    pip install pandas
    pip install networkx


## Instruction
1. "topic_extract.py" is used for extracting topics from each chat content by BERTopic.

2. "topic_tracking_plot.py" is used for obtaining multiple topics tracklet by Hungarian algorithm, and plotting curves for each dynamic topic. 

3. "topic_tracking_properties.py" is used for computing the 20 potential factors for each topic.

4. Factor analysis, regression analysis, and correlation analysis are performed by IBM SPSS Statistics 25.
